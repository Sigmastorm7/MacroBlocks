# MacroBlocks
### Easily make WoW macros with drag'n'drop code blocks

I got tired of googling macro commands/conditions/arguments/etc. so I made this addon that way I never have to look them up again.

The starting set of basic blocks includes 9 commands, 6 conditions, 4 utilities, 2 user input blocks, and 1 smart condition modifier. There are many more blocks and features coming soon.
